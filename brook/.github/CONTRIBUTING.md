### I want to create a PR.

1. Create an issue first
1. Don't use internal package
1. Don't use generics
1. Single function better than multiple functions
1. Single file better than multiple files
1. Single diretory better than multiple directories
1. Prefer struct and function to be exported.
1. Keep it simple, stupid
1. Create PR on `master` branch
